        ## Troubleshoot
        If you have an issue with any Office-JS API and it is not behaving as expected, please go through this [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/) and this [Javascript API Browser](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/) to check if your expectations are correct. 
        In some cases, different platforms behave differently because of platform limitations. These should be documented in the link above.

        ## Make a minimal reproduction
        Please have a minimal reproduction of your issue. Please list down your repro steps in detail. 
        You can also have a repro video attached with the issue. Attach a sample manifest which can be used to repro your issue. You can add these to a Git repo and share it with us.
        This should have easy to understand steps and manifest. The clearer the steps, the easier it is for us to fix the issue. 
        Please share relevant network logs or diagnostic logs also in the repo.  
        If this is a tenant specific issue, please send an email to <> with your Github Issue Title as the subject and a test user account in the body.
